Welcome to compile-time data structures library `juno`.

The purpose of this library is to demonstrate C++ meta-programming concepts documented in the series of articles in ACCU Overload magazine. Here you will find releases and branches corresponding to individual articles:
https://accu.org/index.php/journals/2531 "Set of types", branch/release `overload_146`

If you are looking for older version of `juno` library, please see `original` release and branch. It is fully featured and with unit tests, but might not build under Visual Studio.
